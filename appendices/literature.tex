\chapter{List of Papers Selected for Literature Review}
\label{apx:literature}

This is a comprehensive list of papers selected to compose our work literature
review as described in Chapter~\ref{ch:literature}. Section~\ref{apx:sec:scam} lists the
papers selected from our conference of choice (18th IEEE International Working
Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation - SCAM).
Section~\ref{apx:sec:refs} lists the papers of interest extracted from SCAM papers
that matched our search strings. Finally, Section~\ref{apx:sec:survey} is the subset
of the papers in Section~\ref{apx:sec:refs} that were extracted from the \textit{Survey of
approaches for handling static analysis warnings}~\cite{muske2016survey}.
